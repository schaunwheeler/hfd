The texts depict a common set of principles regarding cuts:

   • A cut can descend from above. All the texts agree that the cut can descend diagonally, but most include a cut coming straight down vertically as well. Some texts show this vertical cut aimed at the head, while others show two vertical cuts, each descending on one side of the head.

   • A cut can ascend from below. Again, some texts only show diagonal ascension, but most include a straight vertical rise as well.

   • A cut can come from the side. The texts differ on whether they depict these side cuts aimed at the body, the head, or even the shoulders or hips specifically.

   • A cut from above, below, or the side can be directed from one’s dominant side (the outside) or the non-dominant side (the inside).

   • A thrust with the point of the blade is considered a separate kind of attack from the slashing motion of the other kinds of cuts.

Likewise, the texts present a common set of principles for guards:

   • A high guard, with the hand raised to the side of the head, the lower half of the blade protecting the head, and the blade pointed forward.

   • A middle guard, with the hand at the hip, the lower half of the blade  protecting the body, the blade pointed up and forward.

   • A low guard, with the hand at the hip, the lower half of the blade  protecting the legs, the blade pointed down and forward.

   • A hanging guard, a sort of sloping parry, with the hand at the head, the blade sloping doward to divert the path of an oncoming strike.

   • A tail guard, the hand at the hip, the blade pointed backward as if sheathed.

   • With the exception of the tail guard, any guard can be reversed from one’s dominant side (outside) to the non-dominant side (inside).

Most of the texts include several other cuts and guards in addition to those listed here, but the nine basic cuts and nine basic guards account for the grand majority of the movement combinations in any manual. The following abbreviations will be used to indicate each of these cuts and guards:
