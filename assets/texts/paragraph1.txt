People’s interest in historical swordsmanship often comes from its connection to other interests, such as later sword forms such as sport fencing, aikido, or kendo; role-playing groups or LARP gaming; theater or choreographed fencing; reenactment; or military history or medieval history. Even a definite interest in learning swordsmanship as conveyed in a particular historical text or by a particular master is complicated by the many ways the texts can be interpreted.

Accommodating all of these goals and priorities within a single app would be very difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, this app:

   • Uses general terms instead of focusing on the vocabulary of a specific text or master.

   • Prioritizes cuts and guards that are shared across historical traditions.

   • Aims to strengthen movement, discipline, and muscle memory rather than teach specific sequences.

   • Targets newcomers more than experienced practitioners (although experienced practitioners could find this app useful for solo practice).
