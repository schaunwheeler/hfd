## Solo Drills for Historical Swordsmanship

A swage is a blacksmith's tool that holds metal in place while it's worked. A swage creates the "fuller" - the indentation that runs along the blade, making the it lighter, broader, and more flexible while still maintaining its strength. Just as a fuller can improve a wide variety of blades, this app is designed to complement training in a wide variety of historical martial arts traditions.

People’s interest in historical swordsmanship often comes from its connection to other interests, such as later sword forms such as sport fencing, aikido, or kendo; role-playing groups or LARP gaming; theater or choreographed fencing; reenactment; or military history or medieval history. Even a definite interest in learning swordsmanship as conveyed in a particular historical text or by a particular master is complicated by the many ways the texts can be interpreted.

Accommodating all of these goals and priorities within a single app would be very difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, this app:

   - Uses general terms instead of focusing on the vocabulary of a specific text or master.
   - Prioritizes cuts and guards that are shared across historical traditions.
   - Aims to strengthen movement, discipline, and muscle memory rather than teach specific sequences.
   - Targets newcomers more than experienced practitioners (although experienced practitioners could find this app useful for solo practice).

While every historical text has its own unique approach and emphasis, nearly all of those texts share certain commonalities. A review of Italian, German, British, Polish, Japanese, and American instructional texts from the 1400s to modern day, focusing on a range of weapons from longsword to dussak to sabre, reveals a common set of principles regarding cuts and guards. Most of the texts include several other cuts and guards in addition to those currently supported by the app, but nine basic cuts and nine basic guards account for the grand majority of the movement combinations in any manual. The app uses a series of abbreviations ("1 for an outside descending cut, "M" for a middle guard, etc.).

The app provides multiple ways to adjust the training program:

   - Mode: If set to "Pre-programmed", the app will cycle through a collection of pre-programmed drills (currently only includes cuts). If set to any one of the manual modes, the app will dynamically create combinations based on the "Weights", "Cut transitions" and "Guard transitions" tabs of the settings screen. The weights are all relative: a cut set at a weight of 4 will occur twice as often as a cut set at a weight of 2, and four times as often as a cut set at a weight of 1.
   - % cuts: Available only for "manual" mode", this decides the balance of cuts to guards in the combos. If set to 0%, the app will always call out guards. If set to 100%, the app will always call out cuts.
   - Drill duration: the amount of time you want to train for.
   - Seconds after call: the number of seconds to wait calling out the next cut or guard.
   - Seconds after combo: the number of seconds to wait after a combination of multiple cuts and/or guards have been called out.
   - Minimum combo: the fewest number of cuts and/or guards to include in a combo.
   - Maximum combo: the largest number of cuts and/or guards to include in a combo.
   - Repeat full combo at end: repeat the combo once before moving on to the next one. If progressive expansion is on, then the repetition will only apply to the full combo, not each progressive subset.
   - Progressively expand combos: if ON, the app will start by calling out the first two cuts and/or guards of the combo, then expand to three, then four, and so on, until the full combo is recited.
